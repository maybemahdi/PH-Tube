          JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language, but it can also be
          tricky to master. In this article, we'll explore some of the
          fundamental concepts of JavaScript, including variable scope, null and
          undefined, and the basics of working with REST APIs.

            Scope of var, let, and const

          <p>
            Understanding variable scope is crucial to writing clean and
            maintainable JavaScript code. In this section, we'll take a closer
            look at the differences between var, let, and const, and how they
            affect the scope of variables in JavaScript.

            Use cases of null and undefined
          </h2>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, null and undefined are used to represent the absence
            of a value. While they may seem similar at first glance, they have
            different use cases and behaviors. In this section, we'll explore
            when to use null and undefined, and how to handle them properly in
            your code.

            The term "REST API" is often used in the context of web development,
            but what does it actually mean? In this section, we'll explain the
            principles of REST, the key concepts of RESTful APIs, and how to
            make requests to a REST API using JavaScript.
